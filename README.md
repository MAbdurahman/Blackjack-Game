# Blackjack-Game
In this version of Blackjack, there is one player and one dealer.  At the start of the game, the player and the dealer receive two cards.  Both of the player's cards are dealt face up.  And the first card of the dealer is dealt face down, and the second card is dealt face up.  The best possible blackjack hand is an opening deal of an ace and a ten point card.  All ties go to the dealer.  The player is given $1000 at the start of the game with a default wager of $25.  The player can adjust the wager, provide it is not above the amount the player has.
